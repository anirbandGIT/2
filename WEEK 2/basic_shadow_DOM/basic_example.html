<!-- When HTML gets converted to the DOM, every element is considered to be a node.
When you have a group of these nodes nested inside one another, it is known as a node tree. -->

    <div class="my-widget">
        <h1>My Widget Header</h1>
        <p>Some my-widget content</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-other-widget">
        <h1>My Other Widget Header</h1>
        <p>Some my-other-widget content</p>
    </div>
    <!-- What's unique about shadow DOM is that it allows us to create our own node trees,
    known as shadow trees. These shadow trees encapsulate their contents and render
    only what they choose. This means we can inject text, rearrange content,
    add styles, etc. -->

    <h1>Class widget</h1>
    <div class="widget">Hello, world!</div>
    <script>
        var host = document.querySelector('.widget');
        var root = host.createShadowRoot();             //Creating shadow DOM
        root.textContent = 'Im inside yr div!';         //Shadow DOM content replaces text
    </script>
    <!-- Using the code above, we've replaced the text content of our .widget div using a
    shadow tree. To create a shadow tree, we first specify that a node should act
    as a shadow host. In this case, we use .widget as our shadow host. Then we add a
    new node to our shadow host, known as a shadow root. The shadow root acts as
    the first node in your shadow tree and all other nodes descend from it. -->

    <!-- The takeaway is that the content inside of the shadow host is not rendered.
    Instead, the content inside of the shadow root is what gets rendered. -->
