When you have a group of these nodes nested inside one another, it is known as a node tree. -->

    <!-- Using the <content> tag, we've created an insertion point that projects the text
    from the .pokemon div, so it appears within our shadow <h1>.
    Insertion points are very powerful because they allow us to change the order
    in which things render without physically altering the source. It also means that
    we can be selective about what gets rendered. -->

    <!-- You may have noticed that we're using a template tag instead of building our shadow DOM
    entirely in JavaScript. I've found that using <template> tags makes the process of
    working with the shadow DOM much easier. -->
